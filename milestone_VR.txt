		- Create a simple map
		- Create a map with different terrain (limiting character movement)
		- Create a map that has items that can be picked up

	Enemy Movement Logic (Dijstrika's)
		- Make enemies move
		- Calculate shortest path to preset position for one enemy; Make him move to it
		- Apply this to all enemies
		- Adjust movement speed based on enemy type and terrain

Rubric:
	- Get SDL program to compile [20 pts]
	- Make main player move [10 pts]
	- Create Map class and load it into SDL [10 pts]
 
Short report on how this challenge went:
I had difficulty understanding some of instructions (especially creating the rubric), but
it provided me with some experience in documenting my software development process.
