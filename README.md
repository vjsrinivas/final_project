# CS317 Final Project Advanced Feature:
### Created by: Vijay Rajagopal

**Purpose**: This repo branch is the "advanced feature" made in addition for the Final Project for CS307. It is a level editor for the game we created in the final project. It allows users to import and export maps as well as quickly edit terrain with a brush tool, which is controlled with a "radius" input. You can place items and enemies by simply selecting the type of item/enemy you want to place and clicking on the desired cell.

**Code Documentation**: This project was made with a vanilla version of Javascript ES6, and the core functionalities can be seen in the `main.js` file.
